## Development Theme Proposal (2025-07-06)

**Focus: Enhancing and maintaining documentation processing tools.**

### Rationale:

The previous development cycle successfully addressed a specific issue in the document processing pipeline. With no outstanding high-priority issues, the current focus should shift towards proactive improvements, ensuring the stability, efficiency, and future extensibility of our documentation tools. This includes:

1.  **Refinement of existing tools**: Reviewing `tools/document_processor.py` and related scripts for potential optimizations, clearer code, or minor feature enhancements.
2.  **Testing and validation**: Implementing or enhancing automated tests for the documentation generation process to prevent regressions and ensure consistent output.
3.  **Documentation of internal tools**: Improving the internal documentation for the development team on how the documentation processing pipeline works, making it easier for future maintenance and contributions.

### Next Steps:

-   Investigate `tools/document_processor.py` for refactoring opportunities.
-   Explore existing testing frameworks or methods applicable to the current tools.
-   Begin outlining a plan for internal documentation of the workflow.
