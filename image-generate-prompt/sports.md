Create an ultra-detailed, dynamic, and energetic scene designed for use as an illustration in business presentations. The image should depict a single sports scene chosen at random from a variety of popular sports (e.g., soccer, basketball, tennis, rugby, baseball, etc.), with the selected sport serving as a metaphor for teamwork, strategy, and collective strength. For example, if a rugby scrum is chosen, emphasize the unified effort and determination of the team as a symbol of effective collaboration in a business environment.

Use a moderately distant or wide-angle composition that avoids close-ups of individual faces. Ensure that characters are seen from a distance that preserves clarity without highlighting fine facial details, so the image remains clean and cohesive even when scaled or zoomed. Maintain anatomically consistent and natural poses with limited overlapping to avoid visual confusion or unrealistic limb placement. Avoid chaotic crowdingâ€”focus on a readable and structured composition.

Render the scene with photorealistic lighting, crisp details, and high-quality textures. The final image must be completely copyright-free and suitable for commercial use. Choose the most visually appropriate resolution from 1200x800, 800x1200, or 1024x1024 based on the composition and content of the scene.
