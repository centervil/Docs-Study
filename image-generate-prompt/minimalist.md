Create an ultra-detailed, high-quality, photorealistic digital artwork with a minimalist style. The image features a smooth gradient background blending a randomly selected pair of complementary or analogous cool and warm tones, accented by subtle, randomly chosen geometric shapes (e.g., circles, lines, triangles) and soft, high-quality textures.

Ensure a balanced composition with ample negative space, focusing on clean lines and a sophisticated aesthetic. Maintain consistency in the minimalist style throughout the elements.

Render the scene with photorealistic lighting that enhances the gradient and textures, ensuring crisp details. The final image must be completely copyright-free, suitable for commercial use, and free of any text, watermarks, or recognizable logos. Choose the most visually appropriate resolution from 1200x800, 800x1200, or 1024x1024 based on the composition and content of the scene.
